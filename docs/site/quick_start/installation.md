The standard tool for installing Python packages is `pip`, which downloads packages from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/). To install `redplanet` from PyPI, run the following command:

```shell
pip install redplanet
pip install --upgrade redplanet  # to upgrade a pre-existing installation
```
