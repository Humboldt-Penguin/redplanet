This document is for anyone who wants to contribute to RedPlanet's code.

We assume you're familiar with GitHub and Git. If not, learn about them [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world){target="_blank"}.

If you're not comfortable with this process, feel free to contact us by [email](mailto:zain.eris.kamal@rutgers.edu) â€” we'd happy to implement your suggestions!

## [1] Developer Tools

### [1.1] Prerequisites

Any operating system should be fine:

| OS:                        | Instructions:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux/MacOS                | Everything should work out of the box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Windows                    | Please just use [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about){target="_blank"}, it takes a few minutes to set up and will make anything programming-related exponentially easier.                                          |
| Nix (OS / package manager) | We use this ourselves since it offers the most reliable/reproducible/sandboxed development environment. Make sure flakes are enabled, and run `just activate-devshell` (or `nix develop`) to enter the development environment based on `flake.nix` and `flake.lock`. |

&nbsp;

Please install:

1. [`uv` by Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/){target="_blank"} for running/managing Python environments.
2. [`just` by Casey Rodarmor](https://just.systems/man/en/prerequisites.html){target="_blank"} as a command runner, very similar to GNU Make / Makefiles. You can preview the recipes by running `just`, or see the exact commands in our `.justfile`:

### [1.2] Install Project Locally

Run `just sync-venv` (or `uv sync --all-extras --all-groups`) to sync the project's environment (`.venv/`) with exact dependencies in the lockfile (`uv.lock`). This will also install `redplanet` in editable mode, so you can make changes to the code and see them reflected immediately. If `.venv/` doesn't exist, it will be created.

## [2] How to Modify/Contribute Code

We assume you've followed the steps above to set up your development environment.

---
### [2.1] Experienced Users

For experienced users, here's a quick guide:

- Please make all changes on the `develop` branch.
- Ensure all tests are passing locally (`just test`) and in the GitHub Actions of your forked repository upon pushing.
- Make a pull request to the `develop` branch of the main repository.

&nbsp;

### [2.2] Beginners

For beginners, here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Fork the repository.
    1. Sign into your GitHub account, go to our repository, and click the ["Fork"](https://github.com/Humboldt-Penguin/redplanet/fork){target="_blank"} button in the top right corner.
    2. On your local machine, `git clone ...` your forked repository. Enter the repository with `cd redplanet`.
2. Make changes on the `develop` branch.
    1. By default you are on the `main` branch, which reflects the latest stable release. Switch to the development branch with `git checkout develop`, which contains the latest development changes.
    2. Create a new branch for your changes with `git checkout -b your-contribution-name`.
    3. Implement and commit your changes.
        - We encourage you to use [Conventional Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/){target="_blank"} (cheatsheets: [\[1\]](https://gist.github.com/Zekfad/f51cb06ac76e2457f11c80ed705c95a3){target="_blank"}, [\[2\]](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13){target="_blank"}) for best practices/standardization, although it's not required.
    4. Ensure all tests are still passing with `just test`.
    5. Push your changes to your fork with `git push origin your-contribution-name`. See the "Actions" tab on your forked repository to see if tests are passing on all python versions and platforms.
3. When your changes are ready to be incorporated into the main repository, make a pull request.
    1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "New pull request" button.
    2. Describe what you changed and why.
    3. Submit the pull request.
    4. We will review your changes and provide feedback if necessary.
