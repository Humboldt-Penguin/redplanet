## [1] Planned Features

- Breaking changes
    - (None currently planned)
- Major features
    - [ ] Plotting (with hillshade background...?)
    - [ ] Add MAVEN magnetometer module
- Minor changes/updates
    - [ ] Update crater database with new [IAU additions](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/SearchResults?Target=20_Mars&Feature%20Type=9_Crater,%20craters){target="_blank"}
        - Redplanet currently uses a database up to 2024-11-26 with 1218 craters -- as of 2025-02-27, there are 1231 craters (13 additions).
- Software/implementation changes
    - [ ] Publish to conda forge ([tutorial](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/tutorials/publish-conda-forge.html#how-to-publish-your-package-on-conda-forge))
    - [ ] Add GitHub actions for CI/CD
        - Specifically, GH actions for [running tests with uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/github/#syncing-and-running), and [publishing the site](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/#with-github-actions) (see justfile for more specific commands!)
    - [ ] Switch from `pandas` to `polars` to save a lot of space and slight performance improvements (move pandas to optional dependecy group)
    - [ ] Change all `loader` modules so they have an additional semi-private method which returns the respective `GriddedData` object, which is then assigned to the global variable by the `load()`/`load(...)`/`_load()` method. This is more clean and extensible in edge cases, e.g. `Crust.moho` wants the pysh topo model to make a crthick model (kind of).
    - [ ] Move `DatasetManager` to `redplanet.helper_functions`?

self note:

- Take inspiration from the following:
    - [mihon](https://mihon.app/changelogs/) (this is much more comprehensible)
    - [shtools](https://shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS/release-notes-v4.html)
    - [uv (but this is only on github) â€” but tbh, i don't really love these...? it's always been a bit confusing to parse](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
