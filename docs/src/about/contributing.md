- How to install/use `uv`
    - RedPlanet is developed using the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/), which provides a fully declarative (see `flake.nix`), reproducible (see `flake.lock`), and reliable development environment.
    - On other systems, prerequisites are:
        - `uv`
            - Installation instructions in their [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) â€” on Windows, I highly suggest using WSL, it takes a few minutes to setup but will save a ton of headache down the road.
        - `just`
            - Simple task runner similar to GNU Make and Makefiles (see next section for more info).

- Explanation of justfile
    - Run `just` to see all options... (insert image)
    - Run tests with `just test` (insert image)
