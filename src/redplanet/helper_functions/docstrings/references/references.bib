  abstract = {Martian thermal state and evolution depend principally on the radiogenic heat-producing element (HPE) distributions in the planet's crust and mantle. The Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) on the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft has mapped the surface abundances of HPEs across Mars. From these data, we produce the first models of global and regional surface heat production and crustal heat flow. As previous studies have suggested that the crust is a repository for approximately 50\% of the radiogenic elements on Mars, these models provide important, directly measurable constraints on Martian heat generation. Our calculations show considerable geographic and temporal variations in crustal heat flow, and demonstrate the existence of anomalous heat flow provinces. We calculate a present day average surface heat production of 4.9 ± 0.3 × 10−11 W · kg−1. We also calculate the average crustal component of heat flow of 6.4 ± 0.4 mW · m−2. The crustal component of radiogenically produced heat flow ranges from <1 mW · m−2 in the Hellas Basin and Utopia Planitia regions to ∼13 mW · m−2 in the Sirenum Fossae region. These heat production and crustal heat flow values from geochemical measurements support previous heat flow estimates produced by different methodologies.},

  abstract = {Abstract Magnetic field measurements show that Mars possesses strong crustal magnetic anomalies that formed when the planet had an active dynamo. To investigate the origin of this magnetization, we used localized power spectrum analyses to constrain the equivalent depths of thin magnetic layers in the crust. Using a new martian magnetic field model that incorporates data from both the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN and Mars Global Surveyor missions, we found that the equivalent magnetization depths on Mars vary from the surface to 72 km. In the northern hemisphere the magnetization depths are found to be on average 9 km, whereas in the southern hemisphere the depths are on average 32 km. If these depths are interpreted in terms of a thick magnetic layer, magnetization in the northern lowlands could extend from the surface to about 18 km depth, whereas for the southern highlands the magnetic layer could extend from about 20 km depth to the base of the crust. The strongest magnetic anomalies are, in general, associated with deep source depths. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis where strong primordial magnetic materials of the northern hemisphere were excavated from the Borealis impact basin, leaving only strong deep remanent magnetization in the southern hemisphere.},
